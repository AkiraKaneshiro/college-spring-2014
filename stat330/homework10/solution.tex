\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Let \(\bar{X}\) denote the mean of a random sample of \(n\) i.i.d.
    observations from a distribution that is \emph{Normal}\((\mu, \sigma^2)\),
    where \(\sigma^2 > 0\), and \(\sigma\) is known but \(\mu\) is unknown.
    \\

    What is the probability that the confidence interval:
    \[
        (
            \bar{X}
            - 2.2
            \frac{
                \sigma
            }{
                \sqrt{n}
            },
            \bar{X}
            + 2.2
            \frac{
                \sigma
            }{
                \sqrt{n}
            }
        )
    \]

    contains the fixed point \(\mu\)?
    \\

    \solution

    According to the standard Z table, when \(z_{\alpha / 2} = 2.2\), the
    probability is 0.9861.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Problem 9.7a from Baron on pg. 301. Answer in the back of the book.
    \\

    Let there be a server that serves concurrent users. Let the average number
    of concurrent users at 100 randomly selected times be 37.7 with a standard
    deviation of \(\sigma = 9.2\).
    \\

    Construct a 90\% confidence interval for the expectation of the number of
    concurrent users.
    \\

    \solution

    We use the standard equation for confidence interval when the mean when
    \(\sigma\) is known. We know that \(\bar{X} = 37.7\), \(n = 100\), and
    \(\alpha = 0.1\). This gives us a \(z_{\alpha / 2} = z_{0.05} = 1.645\) by
    using a table.  This gives us:
    \[
        \bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha / 2}
        \frac{
            \sigma
        }{
            \sqrt{n}
        }
        =
        37.7
        \pm 1.645
        \frac{
            9.2
        }{
            10

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Find a 95\% confidence interval for \(\mu\), the true mean of a normal
    population which has a variance of \(\sigma^2 = 100\).  Consider a sample
    of size 25 that has a mean of 69.3.
    \\

    \solution

    We know that \(\bar{X} = 69.3\), \(n = 25\), and \(\alpha = 0.05\). This
    gives us a \(z_{\alpha / 2} = z_{0.025} = 1.96\) by using a table.  This
    gives us:
    \[
        \bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha / 2}
        \frac{
            \sigma
        }{
            \sqrt{n}
        }
        =
        69.3 \pm 1.96

            10

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    A department store has 10,000 customers charge accounts. To establish the
    amount owed by all its customers, it selected 36 accounts at random and
    found a mean of \$150 and a standard deviation of \$60.
    \\

    \part

    Establish a 95\% confidence interval estimate of the mean amount owed by
    its customers.
    \\

    \solution

    We know that \(\bar{X} = 150\), \(n = 36\), and \(\alpha = 0.05\). This
    gives us a \(z_{\alpha / 2} = z_{0.025} = 1.96\) by using a table. This
    gives us:
    \[
        \bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha / 2}
        \frac{
            \sigma
        }{
            \sqrt{n}

    \]

    \part

    Provide an interpretation for this confidence interval to someone with
    little statistical background. \emph{Hint:} See pg. 248.
    \\

    \solution

    Say there is a piece of paper in a sealed envelope with a number from 1 to
    200 on it. Then let's say that we don't know what this number is. By saying
    that our 95\% confidence interval starts at 130.4 and goes to 169.6, we are
    saying that if we open the envelope and look at the number, we have a 95\%
    chance that our range covers the number on the piece of paper.

    \(s^2_2 = 32\).
    \\

    \solution

    This is a confidence interval for differene of means. This gives us \(\alpha = 0.1\),
    so \(z_{\alpha / 2} = z_{0.05} = 1.645\) then:
    \[
        \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2

    Problem 9.9a from Baron on pg. 301. Answer in the back of the book.
    \\

    Salaries of entry level computer engineers have a Normal distribution with
    unknown mean and variance. Three randomly selected computer engineers have
    salaries: 30, 50, 70.
    \\

    Construct a 90\% confidence interval for the average salary of an
    entry-level computer engineer.
    \\

    \solution

    We have a small sample size, so we need to use the {\tstat}. Using our
    sample, this gives us: \(\bar{X} = 50\), \(\alpha = 0.10\), \(s = 20\).
    Using a \(t\) table, know our {\tstat} has 2 degrees of freedom which gives
    \(t_{0.05} = 2.353\). Thus:
    \[
        \bar{X} \pm t_{\alpha / 2}
        \frac{
            s
        }{

    Cranston, Rhode Island, has the reputation for selling the most expensive
    bubble gum in the U.S.  Ten candy stores were surveyed and it was found

    deviation of 5 cents.
    \\

    \part

    Find a 95\% confidence interval for \(\mu\), the mean gum price.
    \\

    \solution

    With our sample, this gives us: \(\bar{X} = 40\), \(\alpha = 0.05\), \(s = 5\).
    Using a \(t\) table, know our {\tstat} has 9 degrees of freedom which gives
    \(t_{0.025} = 2.262\). Thus:
    \[
        \bar{X} \pm t_{\alpha / 2}

    Find a 99\% confidence interval for \(\mu\), the mean gum price.
    \\

    \solution

    Our new value for \(\alpha\) is 0.01.  Using a \(t\) table, know our
    {\tstat} has 9 degrees of freedom which gives \(t_{0.005} = 3.250\). Thus:

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    An experimenter tested for differences in attitudes toward smoking before
    and after a film on lung cancer was shown. The experimenter tested to see
    if there was a difference between attitudes that people held about smoking
    before and after viewing the film (either less or more favorable).  She
    found a difference which was significant between the 0.02 and 0.05 levels.
    \\

    \part

    Let \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\) represent the mean attitude towards smoking before
    viewing the film and after viewing the film, respectively. What are the assumed
    hypotheses (null and alternative)?
    \\

    \solution

    The hypotheses are as follows:
    \[
        H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2
        \quad
        vs.
        \quad
        H_a : \mu_1 \neq \mu_2

    \part

    What level of significance indicates the greater degree of significance,
    0.05 or 0.02, i.e. for which level of significance will the experimenter be
    more confidence in rejecting null hypothesis in favor of the alternative?
    \\

    \solution

    A lower value is better as it indicates a smaller possibility of the value
    being that extreme.
    \\

    \part

    If her \(\alpha\) level is 0.05, will she reject \(H_0\) in favor of
    \(H_a\)?
    \\

    \solution

    Yes, if her significance is between 0.05 and 0.02 and her \(\alpha\) level is
    0.05, then that means that the level of significance is less than
    \(\alpha\) which is when we reject the \(H_0\).
    \\

    \part

    Will she reject \(H_0\) in favor of \(H_a\) if she employs the 0.01 level?
    \\

    \solution

    No, since our value is between 0.05 and 0.02, an \(\alpha\) value of 0.01
    is too small and we can't reject \(H_0\).
