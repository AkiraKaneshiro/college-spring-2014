\begin{homeworkProblem}
    The \textit{discrete uniform} distribution defined on \([a,b]\), where
    \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, is the probability distribution where any
    number between \(a\) and \(b\) is equally likely to occur. Let \(X\) be the
    discrete uniform variable on \([a, b]\). The pmf of \(X\) is:

    \[
        p(x) = \left\{
            \begin{array}{ll}
                \frac{
                    1
                }{
                    b - a + 1
                }& \quad x \in \{a, a + 1, \ldots, b - 1, b\}
                \\
                0 & \quad \mbox{any other } x
            \end{array}
        \right.

    change as \(a\) and \(b\) move further away from each other?

    Considering the game of \textit{Monopoly}, answer the following questions.
    \\

    Let \(X\) be the outcome of a single roll of the dice, with ``success''
    considered to be rolling doubles and ``failure'' rolling anything else.

    Now let's take a look at the number of turns that are needed until doubles are rolled.
    Let \(Y\) be the random variable representing the number of rolls of the dice
    until doubles comes up. Then \(Y \dist{Geometric}(p)\).
    \\

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    A student is taking a 10 question multiple choice exam, where each question has four possible
    answers and the correct answer is chosen randomly and independent of all other answers. If the
    student guesses ``C'' on every question, then \(X\), the number of questions that the student
    answers correctly, follows a \(\dist{Binomial}(10, 0.25)\) distribution.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    In some city, the probability of rain on any day is 0.60, determined using
    historical climate records. It is known that on rainy days the number of
    traffics has a \(\dist{Poisson}(4)\) distribution.
    \\

    An accident occurred years ago and there are no prcise weather records
    available, but we do know that on the day of the accident in question there
    were 8 accidents in the city.  Use Baye's Rule to determine the probability
    that it was in fact a rainy day.
