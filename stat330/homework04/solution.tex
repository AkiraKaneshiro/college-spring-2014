\begin{homeworkProblem}
    The \textit{discrete uniform} distribution defined on \([a,b]\), where
    \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, is the probability distribution where any
    number between \(a\) and \(b\) is equally likely to occur. Let \(X\) be the
    discrete uniform variable on \([a, b]\). The pmf of \(X\) is:

    \[
        p_X(x) = \left\{
            \begin{array}{ll}
                \frac{
                    1
                }{
                    b - a + 1
                }& \quad x \in \{a, a + 1, \ldots, b - 1, b\}
                \\
                0 & \quad \mbox{any other } x
            \end{array}
        \right.
    \]

    \part

    Find \(\E[X]\).
    \\

    \solution

    The expected value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the \(x\)
    value:

    \[
        \begin{split}
            \E[X] &= \sum_{x = a}^{b} x \cdot p_X(x)
            \\
            &= \sum_{x = a}^{b} x \cdot \frac{1}{b - a + 1}
            \\
            &= \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \sum_{x = a}^{b} x
            \\
            &= \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \left[
                \sum_{x = a}^{b} x - \sum_{x = 1}^{a - 1} x
            \right]
            \\
            &= \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \left[
                \frac{b}{2}(b + 1) - \frac{a - 1}{2}(a - 1 + 1)
            \right]
            \\
            &= \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left[
                b^2 + b - a^2 + a
            \right]
            \\
            &= \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left[
                (b^2 - a^2) + (b + a)
            \right]
            \\
            &= \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left[
                (b + a)(b - a) + (b + a)
            \right]
            \\
            &= \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left[
                (b + a)(b - a + 1)
            \right]
            \\
            &= \frac{b + a}{2}
        \end{split}
    \]

    \part

    Suppose \(c\) is an integer between \(a\) and \(b\). How does \(p_X(c)\)
    change as \(a\) and \(b\) move further away from each other?
    \\

    \solution

    Since since it is a uniform distribution, the value of \(p_X(c)\) will be
    dependent on the distance of \(a\) and \(b\) which is given as \(\frac{1}{b
    - a + 1}\). Thus as \(a\) and \(b\) get farther from each other, that is
    making the denominator of the fraction bigger, thus the probability
    decreases.
    \\

    The highest the probability can be is when \(a = b\) which would make the
    fraction be \(1 / 1\). Thus, again, it makes sense that it decreases as
    \(a\) and \(b\) grow apart.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Considering the game of \textit{Monopoly}, answer the following questions.
    \\

    Let \(X\) be the outcome of a single roll of the dice, with ``success''
    considered to be rolling doubles and ``failure'' rolling anything else.
    Then \(X \dist{Bernoulli}(p)\).
    \\

    \part

    What is \(p\)?
    \\

    \solution

    The probability of rolling doubles, or \(n/\left| \Omega \right|\) where
    the size of \(\Omega = 36\), the total possibilities and \(n = 6\) because
    a 1 can only match a 1, and a 2 can only match a 2, and so on. Thus \(p =
    6/36 = 1/6 \approx .167\).
    \\

    \part

    What are \(\E[X]\) and \(\Var[X]\)?
    \\

    \solution

    Since our distribution is a Bernoulli distribution, the expectation of
    such a distribution is \(\E[X] = p\), so with probability \(p \approx
    .167\), the expectation is thus \(\E[X] = p\).
    \\

    Similarly, the variance for a Bernoulli distribution is defined as
    \(\Var[X] = pq\) with \(p\) and \(q = 1 - p \approx .833\) thus \(\Var[X] =
    pq \approx .139\).
    \\

    \part

    Construct a graph of the cumulative distribution function \(F_X (t)\).
    \\

    \solution

    Solution.
    \\

    Now let's take a look at the number of turns that are needed until doubles are rolled.
    Let \(Y\) be the random variable representing the number of rolls of the dice
    until doubles comes up. Then \(Y \dist{Geometric}(p)\).
    \\

    \part

    Using your answers for 2a for \(p\), what ist he expected number of turns a player will
    need to get out of jail? (Hint: this is \(\E[Y]\)).
    \\

    \solution

    Solution.
    \\

    \part

    What is the probability that a player will need four or more rolls to get
    out of jail?
    \\

    \solution
